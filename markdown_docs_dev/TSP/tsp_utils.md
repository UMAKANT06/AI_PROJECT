## FunctionDef vectorToDistMatrix(coords)

**vectorToDistMatrix: Create the distance matrix**

The `vectorToDistMatrix` function is used to create a distance matrix from a list of coordinates. The function takes a single parameter, `coords`, which is a numpy array of shape `(n, m)`, where n is the number of points and m is the number of dimensions. The function returns a square matrix of size (n x n) where each element represents the distance between the corresponding points.

**Parameters:**

* `coords`: A numpy array of shape `(n, m)` containing the coordinates of the points.

**Code Description:**

The `vectorToDistMatrix` function first calculates the difference between each pair of points using the broadcasting feature of NumPy. It then squares the differences and sums them along the axis=2 to get the distance between each pair of points. Finally, it takes the square root of the distances to get the actual distance matrix.

This function is called by the `SimulatedAnnealing` and `VariableNeighborhoodSearch` classes in the TSP project. The `SimulatedAnnealing` class uses this function to calculate the distance matrix for each iteration of the simulated annealing algorithm, while the `VariableNeighborhoodSearch` class uses it to create a distance matrix for the variable neighborhood search algorithm.

**Note:**
The distance matrix is a square matrix where each element represents the distance between the corresponding points in the coordinate list. The function assumes that the coordinates are of the same dimensionality and that there are no duplicates in the coordinate list. If the input contains duplicates or different dimensions, the output may not be meaningful.

**Output Example:**

For example, if we have a list of coordinates `coords = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`, the function will return a distance matrix of shape `(3 x 3)` where each element represents the distance between the corresponding points. The output would be:
```
[[0, 2, 4],
[2, 0, 6],
[4, 6, 0]]
```
This shows that the distance between the first two points is 2, the distance between the second and third points is 6, and the distance between the first and third points is 4.
## FunctionDef nearestNeighbourSolution(dist_matrix)

**nearestNeighbourSolution**: The function of nearestNeighbourSolution is to compute the initial solution (nearest neighbour strategy) using the given distance matrix.

**parameters**:

* dist_matrix: A list of lists, where each inner list represents a node and its neighbors with their corresponding distances.

**Code Description**: The function starts by selecting a random node from the distance matrix as the starting point for the tour. Then, it iteratively adds nodes to the current solution, selecting the nearest neighbor of the previous node based on the given distance matrix. The algorithm stops when all nodes have been visited and added to the solution.

The relationship between this function and its callers in the project can be seen as follows:

* In TSP/simulated_annealing.py, the SimulatedAnnealing class calls nearestNeighbourSolution to compute the initial solution for the simulated annealing algorithm.
* In TSP/vns.py, the VariableNeighborhoodSearch class also calls nearestNeighbourSolution to compute the initial solution for the variable neighborhood search algorithm.

**Note**: This function uses the random module's randrange() method to select a random node from the distance matrix as the starting point for the tour. The nodes_to_visit list is used to keep track of the remaining nodes that have not been visited yet, and the nearest_node variable is used to store the current nearest neighbor of the previous node.

**Output Example**: A sample return value could be a list of integers representing the nodes in the order they were visited, with each integer representing a node from the distance matrix. For example, if the distance matrix was [[0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 3], [2, 3, 0]], a possible return value could be [0, 1, 2, 3].
