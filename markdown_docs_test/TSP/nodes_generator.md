## ClassDef NodeGenerator

Introduction:
The NodeGenerator class is a crucial component of the TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) algorithm used to generate nodes for the graph. In this documentation, we will explore the functions and attributes of the NodeGenerator class, focusing on aspects relevant to testing. We will cover the initialization of the class, the generate() function, and edge cases, error handling, and return values.

Initialization:
The NodeGenerator class requires three parameters during initialization: width, height, and nodesNumber. The width and height represent the dimensions of the graph, while nodesNumber represents the number of nodes to be generated. The constructor initializes these attributes and sets them to private variables for secure access.

generate():
The generate() function is responsible for generating nodes for the graph. It uses two NumPy libraries: np.random.randint() for generating random integers, and np.column_stack() to stack two arrays horizontally. The function returns a 2D array with shape (nodesNumber, 2) that represents the generated nodes.

Edge Cases:
The generate() function is sensitive to several edge cases, which can affect its output. Some of these include:

* If width or height are set to zero, an error will be raised during initialization due to division by zero.
* If nodesNumber is set to a value less than two, the generate() function will return an empty array.

Error Handling:
The NodeGenerator class raises specific errors for each edge case encountered during its operation. For example, if width or height are set to zero during initialization, a DivisionByZero error is raised. Similarly, if nodesNumber is set to a value less than two during the generate() function call, an IndexError is raised indicating that no elements can be selected.

Return Values:
The return values of the generate() function depend on the inputs provided and the edge cases encountered. In general, the function returns a 2D array with shape (nodesNumber, 2) that represents the generated nodes. However, if an error is raised during initialization or during the generate() call, the function will raise an appropriate error to indicate what went wrong.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, testing the NodeGenerator class requires an understanding of its functions and attributes, as well as the edge cases and error handling that it provides. By thoroughly testing the class, developers can ensure that the generated nodes meet their expected properties and are suitable for use in the TSP algorithm.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, width, height, nodesNumber)
The `__init__` function is a constructor that initializes an instance of the NodeGenerator class. It takes three parameters: `width`, `height`, and `nodesNumber`. The purpose of this function is to set the width and height of the graph and the number of nodes that will be generated. 

Here are some notes on testing and edge cases for the `__init__` function:

* Testing: It's important to test the `__init__` function with different values for `width`, `height`, and `nodesNumber`. For example, you can test the function with a small value for `nodesNumber` and a large value for `width` and `height` to see if it handles unexpected inputs correctly.
* Edge cases: It's important to handle edge cases such as negative values for `width`, `height`, or `nodesNumber`. You can also test the function with a very large value for `nodesNumber` to see if it can handle very large graphs.

In terms of error handling, it's important to check that the function throws an error when the input parameters are invalid. For example, you can test the function with a negative value for `width`, a negative value for `height`, or a negative value for `nodesNumber`.

Finally, in terms of return values, it's important to check that the function returns the expected output. For example, if the function is called with a small value for `nodesNumber`, you can check that it returns a list of nodes that has the correct number of nodes and that all nodes have valid coordinates within the graph.

Overall, testing and edge cases are important aspects of the `__init__` function to consider when testing the NodeGenerator class. It's also important to handle errors and return the expected output.

### FunctionDef generate(self)
The `generate` function is a key component of the TSP/nodes_generator.py/NodeGenerator class and generates the nodes required for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The function takes no arguments and returns a two-dimensional NumPy array containing the x and y coordinates of the generated nodes.

The function first generates a random integer between 0 and `width` using np.random.randint, then applies it to the number of nodes required using the self.nodesNumber attribute. This results in an array of size (self.nodesNumber,2), where each row represents a node with its corresponding x and y coordinates.

The function then returns the resultant array by stacking the two arrays horizontally using np.column_stack. The resulting array is a two-dimensional NumPy array containing the generated nodes' x and y coordinates.

Testers should focus on testing edge cases, error handling, and return values when working with this function to ensure its reliability in generating nodes for the TSP. When testing, it is essential to test various inputs, such as an empty input or a negative value for the number of nodes required. Additionally, testers can also check that the generated nodes are within the bounds specified by `width` and `height`. Finally, testers should verify that the function returns a two-dimensional NumPy array containing the x and y coordinates of the generated nodes.
